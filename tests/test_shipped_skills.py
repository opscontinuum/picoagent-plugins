"""Every skill that ships is loadable, invocable, and actually reaches the model.

Nothing exercised these before. The suite covered SKILL.md parsing in the abstract and it
covered the plugin tools, but no test invoked a skill that ships. A skill whose frontmatter
does not parse, or whose body never reaches the model, is invisible until a user types
``/skill:<name>`` and gets nothing back.

These are deliberately model-free. Skill expansion is deterministic, so driving it through
``ScriptedProvider`` proves the wiring without a live model and without the flakiness one
brings: a small model failing to follow a skill tells you about the model, not about the skill.
Whether a model *obeys* a skill is a separate question and needs a live run to answer.
