"""End-to-end tests against a real MCP server, off by default.

Every other MCP test drives ``tests/fake_mcp.py``, a server written from the same
reading of the specification as the client. That proves the two agree; it cannot prove either
one matches the protocol, because a misreading is a mistake both sides would share and every
test would agree with. These tests close that gap by talking to a server nobody here wrote:
``@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything``, the protocol's own reference server, run in a
container so it is the same server on every machine.

Opt in explicitly::

    export PICOAGENT_E2E_MCP=1
    python -m unittest discover -s tests -v

Without ``PICOAGENT_E2E_MCP=1`` every test here skips, so ``discover`` stays offline and fast
by default and CI is unaffected on a machine that happens to have Docker.

**Assertions are on protocol facts and side effects, never on prose.** The handshake completed
and recorded a negotiated revision, tools came back from ``tools/list`` and were registered, a
named tool ran and returned content the server produced, and the built-in ``read`` is still
``ReadTool`` afterwards. Those hold across server versions. A green run means the wire format
is right; it says nothing about how many tools the reference server happens to ship this month.

Three things can be missing, and each skips with its own fix: the switch is off, Docker is not
installed, or the daemon is not reachable. Skip means the infrastructure is absent. Failure
means it was present and picoagent misbehaved.
