"""Three bypasses that were one defect: the gate and the tool named different files.

A ``tool_call`` guard decides "may this path be touched?" from the model's *argument string*,
and the tool then opens whatever :func:`picoagent.core.tools.resolve_path` makes of that string.
Every guard that resolved the string itself drifted from that function, and each drift is a way
past the guard:

* credential-guard resolved against the *process* directory and never stripped the leading
  ``@`` that ``resolve_path`` strips, so ``@<credentials>`` was inspected as a filename with an
  ``@`` in it - which nothing opens - while ``read`` opened the credentials file and put the key
  in a tool result, and the session log replays that into the next prompt.
* permission-gate matched ``protected`` patterns against the spelling, so ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``
  was refused and the absolute spelling of that same file was not.
* ``confine_to_project`` compared a textually normalised path when the file did not exist yet,
  so the OS followed a symlink on the write that the check had not followed.

These tests are written against calls that exist on both sides of the fix, so each one fails
where the defect is rather than at an import. The seam itself is covered in
``test_path_gate_seam.py``.
